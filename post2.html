  <h1>Law Of Attraction (Not Working)</h1>
  <p><em>By Urja Vaswani</em></p>

  <p><strong>Lessons from Experience, When the Law of Attraction Falls Short</strong></p>

  <p>You saw the movie, read articles, watched videos and tried different methods to manifest your dreams—and nothing works.</p>

  <p>Sometimes in life, after trauma or toxic relationships, it’s not easy to think positive, stay focused, or forget the past. And honestly? You might hate the word <strong>Hope</strong>.</p>

  <p>I'm not going to tell you how it works, or the "right method". Because I don’t have those answers. But I will share what I felt when I tried to use the law of attraction.</p>

  <h2>1. Healing (why?)</h2>
  <p>If you’ve heard about the Law of Attraction, you’ve probably heard about healing too. It’s not easy—I’m still trying. But here’s what I’ve learned:</p>

  <p><strong>• Feel your emotions</strong><br>
  Pretending to be positive all the time is not healthy. You need to feel emotions without guilt.</p>

  <p><strong>• Cherish the memories</strong><br>
  Let yourself remember the good without staying stuck in the past. Even when it’s painful, there’s beauty in acknowledging happiness that once existed.</p>

  <p><strong>• Cry</strong><br>
  Let it out. You don’t need to cry every day, but when you're overwhelmed—allow it.</p>

  <p><strong>• Move on</strong><br>
  After feeling, remembering, and releasing, move forward. Don’t hold on to emotions or people forever.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a healing method—it’s just what helped me stop feeling guilty for not “staying positive.”</p>

  <h2>2. Love Yourself (ok?)</h2>
  <p>Self-love isn’t chanting affirmations or taking bubble baths every weekend.</p>
  <p>To me, self-love means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Knowing your worth, not obsessing over yourself</li>
    <li>Setting boundaries, not being selfish</li>
    <li>Accepting truth and mistakes, not hiding from them</li>
    <li>Choosing to become better for yourself</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So next time someone throws “self-love” around—smile and define it for yourself.</p>

  <h2>3. Life Purpose (panic)</h2>
  <p>They say “there’s no age limit” to finding your purpose. But my parents say otherwise (lol).</p>

  <p>It’s hard to find purpose when you feel stuck, when nothing is working, and when everyone else looks like they’ve figured it out.</p>

  <p>I don’t have the answer. But I know this: sometimes you already know what your soul wants—you just stop listening.</p>

  <h2>4. Still Manifesting</h2>
  <p>I’m still manifesting. Still struggling. Still hoping.</p>

  <p>I’m writing this so you stop being harsh on yourself. Happiness isn’t something that arrives *after* you get everything you want. It starts now.</p>

  <p>If you think happiness is only traveling, shopping, or eating aesthetic food, maybe you’ve given it the wrong definition.</p>

  <p>Change the definition. Let your life be gentle and real. Let it be quiet and still meaningful. Let it be <strong>yours</strong>.</p>

  <p><em>And remember: positivity isn’t “love and light” all the time. It’s just faith.</em></p>
